Readme for the cerealwebapp written in the flask framework. 

Database must be running before starting the webapplication, the docker and cerealwebapp folders each contains a readme on how to start up their respective services

Currently the docker DB does not import any data on startup, run <webadress for server>/import when the server is running to import the test data which will import the csv data into the DB.
